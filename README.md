# 🧾 Employee Payroll System

## 👨‍💻 About the Project

This is a simple **Employee Payroll System** developed in Java, written entirely in a single file: `Main.java`. It demonstrates key **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as abstraction, interfaces, inheritance, and custom exceptions.

The system allows you to manage both full-time and part-time employees, calculate their salaries, and perform basic payroll operations like add, display, and remove.
